            The greed of mortals has awakened a powerful entity long thought
            destroyed. For eons, this mighty champion of the gods has been
            imprisoned in the darkest depths of Exandria. His name has been
            forgotten, as have his heroic deeds. Languishing in despair, he
            calls out for new heroes to save him.
          </p>

          <p>
            This adventure begins in the Wastes of Xhorhas and leads to the
            glimmering oasis-city of Ankâ€™Harel on the continent of Marquet, and
            from there into a sunken realm of gloom, corruption, and sorrow
            known as the Netherdeep. Above it all, the red moon of Ruidus
            watches, twisting the fates of those who have the power to shape the
            course of history.
